We need to known the country of each athlete. There is no column of the country of athletes. We add a column \"country of athlete\".\\n\\nIf the table only needs a few rows to tell whether the statement is True or False, we use f_select_row() to select these rows for it. For example,\\n/*\\ntable caption : jeep grand cherokee.\\ncol : years | displacement | engine | power | torque\\nrow 1 : 1999 - 2004 | 4.0l (242cid) | power tech i6 | - | 3000 rpm\\nrow 2 : 1999 - 2004 | 4.7l (287cid) | powertech v8 | - | 3200 rpm\\nrow 3 : 2002 - 2004 | 4.7l (287cid) | high output powertech v8 | - | -\\nrow 4 : 1999 - 2001 | 3.1l diesel | 531 ohv diesel i5 | - | -\\nrow 5 : 2002 - 2004 | 2.7l diesel | om647 diesel i5 | - | -\\n*/\\nStatement: the jeep grand cherokee with the om647 diesel i5 had the third lowest numbered displacement.\\nFunction: f_select_row(row 1, row 4, row 5)\\nExplanation: The statement wants to check the om647 diesel i5 had third lowest numbered displacement. We need to know the first three low numbered displacement and all rows that power is om647 diesel i5. We select the row 1, row 4, row 5.\\n\\nIf the table only needs a few columns to tell whether the statement is True or False, we use f_select_column() to select these columns for it. For example,\\n/*\\ncol : code | county | former province | area (km2) | population | capital\\nrow 1 : 1 | mombasa | coast | 212.5 | 939,370 | mombasa (city)\\nrow 2 : 2 | kwale | coast | 8,270.3 | 649,931 | kwale\\nrow 3 : 3 | kilifi | coast | 12,245.9 | 1,109,735 | kilifi\\n*/\\nStatement: momasa is a county with population higher than 500000.\\nFunction: f_select_column(county, population)\\nExplanation: The statement wants to check momasa county with population higher than 500000. We need to know the county and its population. We select the column \"county\" and column \"population\".\\n\\nIf the statement is about items with the same value and the number of these items, we use f_group_column() to group the items. For example,\\n/*\\ncol : district | name | party | residence | first served\\nrow 1 : district 1 | nelson albano | dem | vineland | 2006\\nrow 2 : district 1 | robert andrzejczak | dem | middle twp. | 2013†\\nrow 3 : district 2 | john f. amodeo | rep | margate | 2008\\n*/\\nStatement: there are 5 districts are democratic\\nFunction: f_group_column(party)\\nExplanation: The statement wants to check 5 districts are democratic. We need to know the number of dem in the table. We group the rows according to column \"party\".\\n\\nIf the statement is about the order of items in a column, we use f_sort_column() to sort the items. For example,\\n/*\\ncol : position | club | played | points\\nrow 1 : 1 | malaga cf | 42 | 79\\nrow 10 : 10 | cp merida | 42 | 59\\nrow 3 : 3 | cd numancia | 42 | 73\\n*/\\nStatement: cd numancia placed in the last position.\\nFunction: f_sort_column(position)\\nExplanation: The statement wants to check about cd numancia in the last position. We need to know the order of position from last to front.
